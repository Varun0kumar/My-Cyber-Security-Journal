# My Cyber Security Journal

Hi! I’m a postgraduate MCA student with a deep interest in the cybersecurity landscape. This journal is where I document my hands-on technical work and progress into the world of cybersecurity.

### Technical Skill Set
My core technical foundation includes:
- **Networking & Protocols** (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, etc.)
- **Windows Internals** (Authentication, File Systems, Registry)
- **PowerShell & Linux** (System Administration and Automation)

### Career Strategy & Focus
I am currently specializing in **Defensive Security** and **SOC Operations** to build a professional foundation for my entry into the cybersecurity industry. To maintain my edge and fuel my passion for the **Offensive** side, I actively participate in CTFs and labs on platforms like **Hack The Box** and **TryHackMe**. 

I believe in being honest about my learning process, so you'll see my mistakes and my walkthroughs here. This isn't a portfolio of an expert—it's the journal of a dedicated and passionated student.

Thanks for your time..
